# Task 3: Theory

## a

Describe the grammar that defines the language whose strings are the lexemes in Task 1 using a formal notation.
This means not using EBNF, but using the formal notation with sets and tuples.
Refer to slide 53 in Lecture 2.

## b

Describe the grammar that defines the language whose strings are the records returned by the ExpressionTree
function in Task 2, using (E)BNF.

## c

Which kind of grammar is the grammar you defined in step a)?
Is it regular, context-free, context-sensitive, or unconstrained?
What about the one from step b)?
